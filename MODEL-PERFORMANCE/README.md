This is where I keep track of the models' performances

### TOTALS ###
SVM = 6/6 (100%)
FOREST = 6/7 (86%)
LOGMODEL = 7/7 (100%)
NN = 6/6 (100%)

### NOCHE UFC: GRASSO VS SHEVCHENKO ###
SVM and NN models went 6/6
LOGMODEL went 7/7
FOREST went 6/7
If I followed the models and bet intelligently, $10 would've returned $96

### UFC FIGHT NIGHT: FIZIEV VS GAMROT ###
