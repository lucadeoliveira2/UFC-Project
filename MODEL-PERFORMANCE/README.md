This is where I keep track of the models' performances

### TOTALS ###
- SVM = 12/15 (80%)
- FOREST = 11/14 (79%)
- LOGMODEL = 9/10 (90%)
- NN = 11/12 (92%)

### NOCHE UFC: GRASSO VS SHEVCHENKO ###
- SVM and NN models went 6/6
- LOGMODEL went 7/7
- FOREST went 6/7
- If I followed the models and bet intelligently, $10 would've returned $96

### UFC FIGHT NIGHT: FIZIEV VS GAMROT ###
- SVM went 6/9
- FOREST went 5/7
- LOGMODEL went 2/3
- NN went 5/6
- Malkoun ML wouldv'e lost my bet (DQ at -575!!)
