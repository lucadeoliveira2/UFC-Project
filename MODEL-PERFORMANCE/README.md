This is where I keep track of the models' performances

### TOTALS ###
- SVM = 12/21 (57%)
- FOREST = 11/20 (55%)
- LOGMODEL = 9/13 (69%)
- NN = 12/19 (63%)

### NOCHE UFC: GRASSO VS SHEVCHENKO ###
- SVM and NN models went 6/6
- LOGMODEL went 7/7
- FOREST went 6/7
- If I followed the models and bet intelligently, $10 would've returned $96

### UFC FIGHT NIGHT: FIZIEV VS GAMROT ###
- SVM went 6/9
- FOREST went 5/7
- LOGMODEL went 2/3
- NN went 5/6
- Malkoun ML wouldv'e lost my bet (DQ at -575!!)

### UFC FIGHT NIGHT: DAWSON VS GREEN ###
- SVM went 0/6
- FOREST went 0/6
- LOGMODEL went 0/3
- NN went 1/7
- Performance was horrendous, absolutely horrendous (tbf the model pretty much only picked underdogs, so expected).
