- SVM = 17/27 (63%)
- FOREST = 15/25 (60%)

- Spent $70, returned $163

### NOCHE UFC: GRASSO VS SHEVCHENKO ###
- SVM and NN models went 6/6
- LOGMODEL went 7/7
- FOREST went 6/7
- If I followed the models and bet intelligently, $10 would've returned $96

- LOGMODEL went 2/3
- NN went 5/6
- Malkoun ML wouldv'e lost my bet (DQ at -575!!)

### UFC FIGHT NIGHT: DAWSON VS GREEN ###
- SVM went 0/6
- FOREST went 0/6
- LOGMODEL went 0/3
