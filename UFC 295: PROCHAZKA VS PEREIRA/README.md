These are the bets I would place for UFC 295 on 12-11-2023, referencing model predictions.
Sensible Bets:
- Jiri ML at +102
- Pavlovich ML at +110
- BSD at -225
- Castaneda at -135
Return: $10 returns $107

Riskier Bets:
- Dern ML at -220
- Sabatini ML at -120
- Borshchev ML at +100
- Gordon vs Madsen Distance at -295
Return: $10 returns $71.41

Combination returns $762, I wouldn't bet this because of top 2 events

Results: Both have failed
